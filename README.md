These are the slides and sample code for [my August 2011 LRUG presentation](http://lrug.org/meetings/2011/07/18/august-2011-meeting/) titled "Managing Web Application Servers with Puppet".

## Sample Code

In `example/`, you will find a `Gemfile` and `Vagrantfile` to get you up and running with Vagrant and the Puppet manifest used in the presentation.

    $ gem install bundler
    $ cd example
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec vagrant up
